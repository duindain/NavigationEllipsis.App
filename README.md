# NavigationEllipsis

Using NavigationPage.TitleView adds the Ellipsis to WinUI projects even though theres nothing to expand with the work around implemented from https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/12063

I believe using NavigationPage.TitleView somehow prevents the work around from working to remove the ellipsis
